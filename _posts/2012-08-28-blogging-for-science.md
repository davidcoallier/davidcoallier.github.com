# Blogging for Science

Recently I have changed position within the [company](https://engineyard.com) where I work. Having moved from a middle-management position into a more scientific position, my daily tasks have become a lot more scientific and I'm hoping to convey this through this blog. 

For the past few weeks, my pupils have been resting on delightfully interesting mathematics books, academic papers, various studies, predictive analysis models and machine learning open source projects &mdash; All of which I wish to discuss about on this blog at some point. 

Whilst being in the middle of putting together a research programme with our local university, I have been refreshing my memory with the R language.

This blog is not going to be about random musings, but will rather be focused on being an academic reference for any data-scientist, applied mathematician and statistician. The goal is to have a scientific blog that focuses on my main topic of research which is statistical mathematics, adaptive predictive modeling, machine learning and artificial intelligence. If you feel like posting something, feel free to [issue a pull request](https://github.com/davidcoallier/davidcoallier.github.com).
