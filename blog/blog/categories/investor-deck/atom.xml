<p>For those of you who are not aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a>, it is a clandestine national security electronic surveillance program that has been ran by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> since 2007. </p>

<p>In an attempt to remain neutral, I’m going to say that it has caused much confusion and anger in the online community. Operating under incomplete information, I will reserve my judgement on the matter until supplementary facts come out.</p>

<p>Being someone with a sense of humour, I thought it would be funny to slip into PRISMs’ shoes for a minute and see how it would feel if PRISM were to be a startup attempting to raise money.</p>

<h1 id="investor-pitch-deck">Investor Pitch Deck</h1>

<p>My rules for entrepreneurs creating investor decks are pretty simple. Only a few slides have to be present:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The product presentation,</li>
  <li>The Problem Description,</li>
  <li>The Solution to The Problem,</li>
  <li>The Market Validation,</li>
  <li>The Market Size,</li>
  <li>The Product details,</li>
  <li>The Business and Revenue Model,</li>
  <li>The Adoption and Expansion Plan,</li>
  <li>The Competition and Competitive Advantage,</li>
  <li>The Ask (How much you’re looking for).</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to allow anyone who isn’t in the room to catch a glimpse of your potential without having to read a full business plan (My views on business plans are also quite opinionated).</p>

<h1 id="the-prism-investor-deck">The PRISM Investor Deck</h1>

<p>Here’s an example of what an investor deck for PRISM might look like:</p>
