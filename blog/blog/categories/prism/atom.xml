<p>For those of you who are not aware of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a>, it is a clandestine national security electronic surveillance program that has been ran by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> since 2007. </p>

<p>In an attempt to remain neutral, I’m going to say that it has caused much confusion and anger in the online community. Operating under incomplete information, I will reserve my judgement on the matter until supplementary facts come out.</p>

<p>Being someone with a sense of humour, I thought it would be funny to slip into PRISMs’ shoes for a minute and see how it would feel if PRISM were to be a startup attempting to raise money.</p>

<h1 id="investor-pitch-deck">Investor Pitch Deck</h1>

<p>My rules for entrepreneurs creating investor decks are pretty simple. Only a few slides have to be present:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The product presentation,</li>
  <li>The Problem Description,</li>
  <li>The Solution to The Problem,</li>
  <li>The Market Validation,</li>
  <li>The Market Size,</li>
  <li>The Product details,</li>
  <li>The Business and Revenue Model,</li>
  <li>The Adoption and Expansion Plan,</li>
  <li>The Competition and Competitive Advantage,</li>
  <li>The Ask (How much you’re looking for).</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to allow anyone who isn’t in the room to catch a glimpse of your potential without having to read a full business plan (My views on business plans are also quite opinionated).</p>

<h1 id="the-prism-investor-deck">The PRISM Investor Deck</h1>

<p>Here’s an example of what an investor deck for PRISM might look like:</p>

<iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/22831865" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""> </iframe>
<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/david.coallier/prism-investordeck" title="PRISM seed-stage Investor Deck" target="_blank">PRISM seed-stage Investor Deck</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/david.coallier" target="_blank">David Coallier</a></strong> </div>

<p>This is only humouristic and does not intend to misinform people. Should you have concerns about the deck, feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcoallier">twitter @davidcoallier</a>.</p>
