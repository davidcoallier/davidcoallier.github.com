    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Mapping the Streets of Ireland With R and ggplot2</h1>

<p>Earlier today an interesting article about plotting <a href="http://statistik-stuttgart.de/2013/04/19/r-street-of-france/">the streets of france</a> appeared in my feed. What Simon does in his blog post is essentially read OSM street-lines-data for France and displays it in what I find to be a rather traditional and elegant way.</p>

<p>The first thing I immediately though of was: &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see this for Ireland&#8221;. As an OSX user, it took a few tricks to get the article replicated for Ireland therefore I&#8217;ve decided to share my notes.</p>

<p>Should you wish to replicate this for your country, here are some notes I&#8217;ve taken.</p>

<h2>Get The Data</h2>

<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need to do is get data off the <a href="http://www.geofabrik.de/">Geofabrik</a> servers. Being my first time transforming data I didn&#8217;t know where to look, and what to look for.</p>

<p>Firstly, I found out this URL: http://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html which contains links to <code>.osm.pbf</code>&#8217;, <code>.shp.zip</code>, and <code>osm.zip</code> files.</p>

<p>Not unlike Simon, you&#8217;ll have to download the <code>.osm.pbf</code> file understanding that you&#8217;ll have to convert it to an osm-friendly format. The <code>.shp.zip</code> file contained too many dimensions for me to care to learn how it works.</p>

<h2>Convert The PBF file</h2>

<p>Second step is to unzip, then convert the downloaded <code>pbf</code> file to an <code>o5m</code> file, and finally filter the parts of the <code>osm</code> file you want to work with. Let&#8217;s see how you do all of that.</p>

<p>After acquiring <a href="http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert.c">osmconvert</a> and <a href="http://m.m.i24.cc/osmfilter.c">osmfilter</a>, you&#8217;ll need to compile them.</p>

<p>For <strong>osmconvert</strong>, it&#8217;s as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; wget -O - http://m.m.i24.cc/osmconvert.c | cc -x c - -lz -O3 -o osmconvert
</code></pre>

<p>And for <strong>osmfilter</strong> again:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; wget -O - http://m.m.i24.cc/osmfilter.c |cc -x c - -O3 -o osmfilter
</code></pre>

<p>After having compiled <strong>osmconvert</strong> and <strong>osmfilter</strong>, you are ready to begin the conversion of the <code>.pbf</code> file to <code>.o5m</code> to <code>.osm</code>.</p>

<h3>Convert From PBF to o5m</h3>

<p>Using the compiled <code>osmconvert</code>, convert the <code>pbf</code> from <code>o5m</code> like such:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; ./osmconvert ireland-and-northern-ireland-latest.osm.pbf --out-o5m -o="ireland.o5m"
</code></pre>

<h3>Convert From o5m to osm</h3>

<p>Now using the second compiled program <code>osmfilter</code>, extract the parts you are interested in (Again, this is directly taken from Simon&#8217;s article):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>./osmfilter ireland.o5m --keep="highway=motorway =motorway_link =trunk 
</span><span class='line'>=trunk_link =primary =primary_link =secondary =secondary_link =tertiary 
</span><span class='line'>=tertiary_link =living_street =pedestrian =residential =unclassified 
</span><span class='line'>=service" --drop-author --drop-version &gt; ireland.osm</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>QuantumGIS</h2>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve converted the <code>pbf</code>, and filtered the <code>o5m</code> into a cleaned <code>osm</code>, I needed to transform the <code>osm</code> file into an <code>shp</code> shapefile.</p>

<p>You can get QuantumGIS from http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis. Follow the requirements, and you will be able to open up QuantumGIS.</p>

<h3>QuantumGIS OpenStreetMap Plugin</h3>

<p>Before converting your layers to <code>shp</code> files, you will need to enable the OpenStreetMap Plugin in QGIS.</p>

<ol>
<li>Top menu, select &#8220;Plugins&#8221; > &#8220;Manage Plugins…&#8221;,</li>
<li>From the Manage Plugins windows, search for &#8220;Open&#8221; and enable the OpenStreetMap core plugin</li>
</ol>


<h3>Loading OSM file into QuantumGIS</h3>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve installed the OpenStreetMap plugin, a new &#8220;Top Menu&#8221; item should have appeared in QuantumGIS. Look for a menu-item named &#8220;Web&#8221;.</p>

<p>From there, you will have multiple choices under the <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> option. Select <code>Load OSM from file</code> and select the <code>osm</code> file we&#8217;ve created before.</p>

<h3>QuantumGIS Layers</h3>

<p>You&#8217;re nearly there. Now, on the left-handside, you will see 3 layers: {country}<em>streets_points, {country}</em>streets_line, {country}_streets_polygons.</p>

<p>Unselect points, and polygons. Keep only lines.</p>

<h3>Save as SHP</h3>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve only the lines for your country/region/area, from the top menu, select <strong>Layer</strong> > <strong>Save As</strong> and save your shp shape file.</p>

<h2>Getting R-eady</h2>

<p>Finally some <strong>R</strong>&#8230;</p>

<p>Now, in order to continue, you will need to make sure the following packages are installed:</p>

<ol>
<li>ggplot2</li>
<li>maptools</li>
<li>proto</li>
<li>sp</li>
</ol>


<p>If you don&#8217;t have them, you can install them with:</p>

<pre><code>R&gt; install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'maptools', 'proto', 'sp'))
</code></pre>

<h2>Loading the Data in R</h2>

<p>You have all the required packages, your files have been converted into the proper <code>shp</code> format, you are now ready to load the data into something that can be displayed:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5421734.js?file=z-ggplot-for-blog.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>shpIreland &lt;- readShapeLines(&quot;path/to/shapefile/file.shp&quot;)
linesIreland &lt;- conv_sp_lines_to_seg(shpIreland)
rm(shpIreland)

streets &lt;- geom_segment2(data=linesIreland, 
                         aes(xend=elon, yend=elat), 
                         size=.055, 
                         color=&quot;black&quot;)

p &lt;- ggplot(linesIreland, aes(x=slon,y=slat)) + 
    streets + 
    scale_x_continuous(&quot;&quot;, breaks=NULL) + 
    scale_y_continuous(&quot;&quot;, breaks=NULL) +
    labs(title=&quot;Streets of Ireland and Northern Ireland 2013&quot;) +
    theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill='#f5f4e0')) +
    theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill='#f5f4e0')) </code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Please note that <code>geom_segment2</code> and <code>conv_sp_lines_to_seg</code> are respectively third-party functions from <a href="http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/02/great-maps-ggplot2/">Spatial Analysis UK</a>, and <a href="http://muon-stat.com/landkarten/convert_shp_line_to_seg.R">Simon Müller</a>. You can find a script attached to this <strong>gist</strong> that contains all the code.</p>

<h2>Resulting ggplot2 Image</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s what the end result with a map that displays the sparse streets of Ireland looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://hostr.co/file/PlFMCIFuKiiT/ireland-streets-small.png" alt="Small Street" /></p>

<h2>Title for Edward R. Tufte</h2>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ve saved the plot as a PDF from RStudio, and opened it with Adobe Illustrator which allows me to edit various parts of the plot. That is how the title has been changed. ( <strong>That&#8217;s a pretty big tip right there, write that down</strong> )</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever read Edward R. Tufte, you may have come across one of his book called: <strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong> which displays very elegant, <code>Ye Olde Plot</code> types of plots. It is the reason why this map has an edited title, even though I didn&#8217;t have time to find the proper font so I would agree that it looks slightly sloppy.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the original image, please see <a href="http://hostr.co/file/yKZBiz7xww6K/ireland-streets.png">the larger image</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s fairly simplistic, and I believe it created what is to be an elegant old-style plot of Ireland&#8217;s streets (which comprises <em>2,133,736</em> street-data points).</p>

<p>Thanks to Simon for his original article.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Load Data With Hmisc</h1>

<p>Often times when working with data in <code>R</code>, you find yourself needing to summarise a <strong>data.frame</strong> by a column, a
<code>SELECT SUM(..)</code> or <code>SELECT COUNT(..)</code> in MySQL if you will.</p>

<p>For instance, you may have a lot of page-visits to analyse and you aren&#8217;t quite certain how to summarise some
of that data using <code>R</code>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider the following (trivial) dataset:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=1.csv'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>user, created.at, pages.visited
julie, 2011-11-16 03:31:56 GMT, 3
julie, 2011-11-16 04:22:33 GMT, 5
jack, 2011-11-16 07:19:13 GMT, 8
jack, 2011-11-16 12:39:02 GMT, 9
julie, 2011-11-17 12:39:02 GMT, 3</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Let&#8217;s load this <strong>csv</strong> file into <code>R</code> using a package called <strong>Hmisc</strong>:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=2.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require(Hmisc)
require(plyr)
require(ggplot2)

data &lt;- csv.get('path/to/csv-file.csv', header=TRUE)</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>By using <code>csv.get</code> we essentially create a <code>data</code> variable of type  <em>data.frame</em> on which we can start operating.</p>

<h1>Shape the data (Clean)</h1>

<p>The first thing we&#8217;ll want to do is format the <code>created.at</code> field so that it is parsable and formattable.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this analysis, let&#8217;s assume that we are based in Los Angeles. If we look closely at the data we have loaded, we
notice the timezone of the <code>data$created.at</code> field being <strong>GMT</strong>.</p>

<p>Considering we are in Los Angeles, visualising <strong>GMT</strong> data will not be as intuitive for our team, therefore we are
going to start by changing the timezone (and values) of the <code>data$created.at</code> to &#8220;Los Angeles&#8221; times.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=3.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>data$created.at &lt;- as.POSIXct(
    format(data$created.at, tz=&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; usetz=TRUE)
)</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>We now have data that is ready to be parsed, and that is represented with local Los Angeles times. We decide we want
to see how people are using the data per hour of the day.</p>

<p><code>R</code> <em>data.frame</em>s are fairly versatile and allow us to add the hour for each entry as easily as:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=4.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>data$hour &lt;- format(data$created.at, '%H')</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Our <code>data</code> now contains the <strong>hour</strong> column and looks like:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=5.csv'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>user          created.at pages.visited hour
1 julie 2011-11-16 03:31:56            3   03
2 julie 2011-11-16 04:22:33            5   04
3 jack 2011-11-16 07:19:13             8   07
4 jack 2011-11-16 12:39:02             9   12
5 julie 2011-11-17 12:39:02            3   12</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>At this point we want to count the number of pages visited per hour, per user. If we were using
an SQL based solution, we could simply do something like:</p>

<p>SELECT SUM(pages.visited) as countPerHour, user, hour FROM data GROUP BY user, hour</p>

<p>The only problem, is we aren&#8217;t using an SQL-based solution, therefore we need to learn how to
manipulate and summarise data from within <code>R</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>plyr</code> package in <code>R</code> allows us to manipulate lists, dataframes, etc. very easily. In this
instance, it also allows ut to summarise as if we were using and SQL-based query.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=6.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>byHour &lt;- ddply(data, .(user, hour), summarise, countPerHour=sum(pages.visited))</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>We now have a new <em>data.frame</em> <code>byHour</code> which contains the sum of visited page per hour per user.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s say we also want to take a look at the visits by weekday instead of by hour. We&#8217;ll start by adding
the weekday to our original <code>data</code> <em>data.frame</em> and again, we&#8217;ll use <code>ddply</code> from <code>plyr</code> to sum/count
the number of visits per weekday:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=7.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>data$weekday &lt;- weekdays(data$created.at)
byWeekday &lt;- ddply(data, .(user, weekday), summarise, countPerDay=sum(pages.visited))</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>You now have data summarised that is similar to what you would traditionally get with
MySQL by doing <code>SELECT SUM(hour) as countPerHour, user, hour FROM data GROUP BY user, user</code> or even
<code>SELECT SUM(weekday) as countPerDay, user, weekday FROM data GROUP BY user, weekday</code>.</p>

<p>The difference, is that you can start visualising your data a lot faster now that you have a
formatted <em>data.frame</em>.</p>

<h1>Visualise Your Cleansed Data</h1>

<p>As with most analysis, you will want to visualise this data-set. Preferably, you&#8217;ll generate a few
plots and identify which ones pleases you the most.</p>

<h3>Visited Pages Per Hour</h3>

<p>Lets see how we can use <code>ggplot2</code> to visualise this data-set in a few different ways:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=8.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>ggplot(byHour, aes(x=hour, y=as.numeric(countPerHour))) + 
    geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
    labs(title=&quot;Count per hour for all users&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Visits Per Hour&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Hour of the day&quot;) +
    theme_bw()</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><img src="https://hostr.co/file/P6yIYUIGBJzK/plot1.png" alt="Plot1" /></p>

<p>Now this seems to be exhibiting an upward trend however with only 2-different users,
our analysis is fairly weak.</p>

<h3>Visited Pages Per Hour Per User</h3>

<p>What if we decide to put the visited page, per user, as columns but this
time we&#8217;ll put them side-by-side so we can compare the two users:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=9.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>ggplot(byHour, aes(x=hour, y=as.numeric(countPerHour))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=user), position=&quot;dodge&quot;) +
  labs(title=&quot;Dodge per hour per user&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Visits Per Hour&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Hour of the day&quot;) +
  theme_bw()</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><img src="https://hostr.co/file/5t8GYEOJimA9/plot2.png" alt="Plot2" /></p>

<p>From that we can now see that Julie is the only one that visited pages between 3am and 4am. On the other hand,
at 7am, only Jack used the site. At 12pm, both users used the site but Jack used it more.</p>

<p>The interesting part in this is the:</p>

<pre><code>geom_bar(aes(fill=user), position="dodge")
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the plotting-engine to fill bars with colours for each user, but then tells the engine
to <strong>dodge</strong> the bars instead of say <strong>stacking</strong> them.</p>

<p>What this shows is that our upwards trend now shows that only 1 user is using it more as the hours progress
and that Julie is in fact using it less.</p>

<h3>User-Faceted Visited Pages Per Hour</h3>

<p>Another way of visualise this would be to seperate the users into facets as such:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=10.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>ggplot(byHour, aes(x=hour, y=as.numeric(countPerHour))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=user), stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
  labs(title=&quot;Pages visited per hour of day&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Visits Per Hour&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Hour of the day&quot;) +
  theme_bw() + facet_grid(user~.)</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><img src="https://hostr.co/file/iYp5TasMxCGh/plot3.png" alt="Plot3" /></p>

<p>From this, what you need to look at is:</p>

<pre><code>facet_grid(user~.)
</code></pre>

<p>which splits the plot into 2 facets, each facet being the <code>user</code> field.</p>

<h3>Visited Pages Per Weekday</h3>

<p>Now considering we don&#8217;t have much data in our example data-set, this will yield fairly
dissapointing results however we&#8217;ll look at a way to change how the axis is displayed:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=11.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>ggplot(byWeekday, aes(x=weekday, y=as.numeric(countPerDay))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=user), position=&quot;dodge&quot;) +
  labs(title=&quot;Dodge per hour per user&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;Visits Per Hour&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Hour of the day&quot;) +
  theme_bw() + coord_flip()</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><img src="https://hostr.co/file/AezmAnWzfHZw/plot4.png" alt="Plot4" /></p>

<p>The interesting part from this snippet is:</p>

<pre><code>coord_flip()
</code></pre>

<p>Which basically takes the x-axis and flips it on its side. In the case of weekdays, we have a maximum
of seven wherein the names can be long (&#8220;Wednesday&#8221;, &#8220;Saturday&#8221;, etc). This makes it a lot easier
to read and visualise.</p>

<p>From the previous plot, we can easily see that the only person that visited pages on Thursday was Julie,
however on Wednesday, Jack visited a lot more pages than Julie. Should we assume that Jack didn&#8217;t do
any work on Wednesday? I&#8217;ll make you draw your own conclusions ;-)</p>

<h3>User-Weekday-Faceted Visited Pages Per Hour</h3>

<p>There are many different ways of looking at this type of data and I hope I&#8217;ve conveyed the power of <code>R</code> and the rapidity at
which it enables you to prototype. <code>R</code> makes it very easy to <strong>load</strong>, <strong>manipulate</strong> and <strong>visualise</strong> data rapidly.</p>

<p>Now assuming you had many different weekdays and you wanted to visualise the number of pages visited per day per hour. You could do
something similar to:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5438020.js?file=12.r'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>byWeekdayHour &lt;- ddply(data, .(user, hour, weekday), summarise, countPerHour=sum(pages.visited))

byWeekdayHour$weekday &lt;- factor(
    byWeekdayHour$weekday, 
    levels=c('Wednesday', 'Thursday')
)

ggplot(byWeekdayHour, aes(x=hour, y=as.numeric(countPerHour))) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill=user), stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
    labs(title=&quot;Pages visited per hour of day&quot;) +
    ylab(&quot;Visits Per Hour&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Hour of the day&quot;) +
    theme_bw() + facet_grid(user~weekday)</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><img src="https://hostr.co/file/TfPo8ZPJC0OX/plot5.png" alt="Plot5" /></p>

<p>The first thing we do is we select per user, hour and weekday and sum the visited pages. The second part of the
snippet, the part that contains <code>factor(...)</code> is only so we order the weekdays in the proper order&#8230; Wednesday
comes before Thursday therefore we re-order it (Otherwise Thursday comes before Wednesday (T vs W)).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For the less experienced <code>R</code> users, keep in mind that load and intensively manipulating data is going to be of
utmost importance when you prototype with R. Visualising is also a very important part of the analysis as it
allows for your cognitive functions to identify patterns before investing time into a deeper analysis.</p>

<p>Now go forth, be crazy.</p>
